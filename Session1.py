# 1. PRINTING OUTPUT
# Displaying data and results is a fundamental aspect of quantitative analysis.
print("Welcome to FinTech @ IU")

# 2. VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES
# QT deals with a mix of strings, integers, floats, and more.

# Stock ticker as a string:
# QUESTION: What is f at the start of the Print function arguments?
ticker = "AAPL"
print(f"Ticker: {ticker}")

# Stock price as a float:


# Trading volume as an integer:
volume = 1000000
print(f"Volume: {volume} shares")

# 3. LISTS AND DATA COLLECTION
# Lists can store historical prices or other financial metrics.
historical_prices = [142.45, 143.5, 144.2, 145.32]
historical_prices_tup = (142.45, 143.5, 144.2, 145.32)

    'high': 145.0,
    'low': 142.7,
    'close': 144.2
}

# 4. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
# Conditional logic can be used to make trading decisions.
# We could also send a request to a trading firm given these conditions.

    print("Consider selling.")
elif price < 140:

# Loops help in data analysis, especially when dealing with time series data.

# Functions can encapsulate trading strategies or analysis methods.

# 7. IMPORTING MODULES
# Quantitative trading often requires external libraries for complex computations.
# As an introduction, let's use Python's built-in `statistics` for mean and standard deviation.
import statistics

# Given an initial price and a final price, calculate the profit (or loss) for a stock.

# TODO: Print the result with a proper message (e.g., "Profit of $5" or "Loss of $3")

# PROBLEM 2: Extending the Historical Data Analysis
# Given a list of historical prices, calculate the average price and determine the number of days the price was above this average.

# Calculate the median and variance of the `historical_prices` using the `statistics` module. Print the results.
